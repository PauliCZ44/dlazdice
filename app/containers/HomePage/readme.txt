I created the Dlazdice as a main component (main part with logic and server request is in index.js). 
I also created some subcomponents in "components" folder (DlazdiceInput, DlazdiceLayout, DlazdiceView, Modal). 
I made styles.csss by hand. 


Other files can be skipped, as i did not created them.
I used this template  (https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) for quick start. 
But the boilerplate contains also some additional stuff, that i did not used.
