I created the Dlazdice as a main component (main part with logic and server request is in index.js). 
I also created some subcomponents in "components" folder (DlazdiceInput, DlazdiceLayout, DlazdiceView, TableSetting, TilesIcon, Modal). 
I made styles.scss by hand. 

Other files can be skipped, as i did not created them.
I used this template  (https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) for quick start. 
But the boilerplate contains also some additional stuff, that i did not used.

To start app - use "npm start" to start app. 
Use "npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json" to start dev server with mock data.
